## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Architecture

The platform is built around the `BeliefMarketFHE` smart contract which leverages **ZAMA's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** for privacy-preserving betting:

```solidity
contract BeliefMarketFHE {
    struct BetInfo {
        address creator;
        uint256 platformStake;    // 0.02 ETH platform fee
        uint256 voteStake;        // Min 0.005 ETH per bet
        uint256 expiryTime;       // 5 minutes to 30 days
        bool isResolved;
        euint64 yesVotes;         // Encrypted vote tally
        euint64 noVotes;          // Encrypted vote tally
        uint64 revealedYes;       // Decrypted results
        uint64 revealedNo;        // Decrypted results
        uint256 prizePool;        // Total ETH staked
        bool yesWon;              // Winner determination
    }
}
```

### Privacy-Preserving Betting Mechanism

#### 1. **Encrypted Vote Submission**
- All votes are encrypted client-side using ZAMA FHE before blockchain submission
- Vote choices (Yes/No) and amounts remain hidden until market resolution
- Uses `euint64` encrypted integers for vote tallies

#### 2. **Homomorphic Vote Aggregation**
```solidity
// Votes are aggregated without revealing individual choices
bet.yesVotes = FHE.add(bet.yesVotes, FHE.select(isYes, weight, zero));
bet.noVotes = FHE.add(bet.noVotes, FHE.select(isNo, weight, zero));
```

#### 3. **Decryption & Resolution Process**
- After market expiry, only the creator can request vote decryption
- ZAMA oracle service decrypts the tallies via `requestDecryption()`
- Results are revealed through a cryptographic callback mechanism

### Market Lifecycle

#### **Phase 1: Market Creation**
1. Creator pays platform fee (0.02 ETH) 
2. Sets minimum bet amount (‚â•0.005 ETH)
3. Defines market duration (5 minutes - 30 days)
4. Market becomes active for betting

#### **Phase 2: Betting Period**
1. Users place encrypted bets with equal stakes
2. Vote choices encrypted using FHE before submission
3. Real-time bet counting without revealing individual votes
4. Prize pool accumulates with each bet

#### **Phase 3: Market Resolution**
1. Market expires, betting closes
2. Creator requests tally decryption from ZAMA oracle
3. Oracle decrypts vote totals and triggers callback
4. Winner determined by majority vote (Yes > No or vice versa)

#### **Phase 4: Prize Distribution**
1. Winners claim proportional share of prize pool
2. Ties result in full refunds to all participants
3. One-time claiming with replay protection

### Prize Distribution Formula

```javascript
// Winner's prize = (Total Prize Pool √ó User Stake) √∑ Total Winning Stakes
prize = (prizePool * userStake) / totalWinningWeight
```

### Security Features

#### **Smart Contract Security**
- Reentrancy protection on all state-changing functions
- Input validation and access controls
- Emergency pause functionality
- Overflow protection with SafeMath operations

#### **Privacy Guarantees**
- **Zero Knowledge**: Individual vote choices never revealed on-chain
- **Encrypted Aggregation**: Vote tallies computed homomorphically
- **Temporal Privacy**: Results hidden until official resolution
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: ZAMA oracle provides verifiable decryption

### Data Architecture

#### **On-Chain Data (Encrypted)**
- Market metadata and parameters
- Encrypted vote tallies (`euint64`)
- Prize pool and resolution status
- User participation tracking

#### **Off-Chain Data (Firebase)**
- Market descriptions and metadata
- User comments and social features
- Activity feeds and leaderboards
- Real-time UI updates
