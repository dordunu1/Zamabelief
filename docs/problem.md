# Problem

Traditional prediction markets face several challenges that limit their effectiveness and adoption:

- **Lack of privacy:** Votes and stakes are often public, leading to social pressure and manipulation.
- **Vote buying & manipulation:** Public votes can be bought or coerced, undermining true market sentiment.
- **Centralized control:** Many platforms rely on trusted intermediaries for resolution and payouts.
- **Poor claim/refund UX:** Mass distribution of rewards is not scalable and can be expensive.
- **Scalability issues:** Handling payouts for large numbers of users is inefficient and costly.
