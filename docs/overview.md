# Overview

## What are Prediction Markets?
Prediction markets are platforms where users can bet on the outcome of future events. They aggregate the collective wisdom and conviction of participants to forecast real-world outcomes.

## Why Conviction-Based Markets?
Traditional prediction markets often suffer from manipulation, lack of privacy, and poor scalability. Conviction Markets introduces a new paradigm where users stake their belief (conviction) and outcomes are determined by the weight of conviction, not just the number of votes.
